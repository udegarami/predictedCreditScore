README for Streamlit UI

Introduction

This is a Streamlit-based front end for the prediction of likelihood of a customer to pay back his loan. The prediction is based on anonymized banking data. The user can select a customer from a listbox, and the application will give the prediction as well as the 10 most similar customers from a training database. The prediction is done using a XGB Classifier and the closest customers are found using KNN.

Features

- Customer selection from a listbox
- Prediction of likelihood of customer to pay back loan
- 10 most similar customers from training database
- Information on the model used, including hyperparameters and evaluation metrics
- Shap analysis and DataDrift analysis for data scientists
